AtomDesktop
===========


What is it ?
------------

A smart desktop assistant who answer all your questions. 
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) used in this project :
- Google Speech Recognition API (Google has not publicly covered the API, so I do not grant it will be always 100% working). Doesn't require any APPID or whatever.
- Wolfram Alpha API. You have to register on [WolframAlpha's Developer portal](https://developer.wolframalpha.com/portal/apisignup.html) and register an application. Then enter the ID given to you as value of the static String "appid" in WolframRequest.java 

This application MUST be used with a PHP server you have access to (access means that you have the username, password and ftp server adress of this server).
There are great Web Hosting services such as [alwaysdata.com](https://www.alwaysdata.com/) which offers free mutualised hosting plans (for free) that support a bunch of languages (Django, Ruby on Rails, Symfony, Python, PHP, and others)

**What do I put on my server?**

How to use it
-------------

When opening Eclipse, select as workspace the "eclipse" folder you've extracted from the downloaded archive (zip, or even tarball).
If the project isn't already on the Package Explorer, create a project called `Atom`. 
The editable content is located in the package `me.atom.windowsj`.
In `WolframRequest.java`, fill the String called `appid` (line 17) with the App ID given to you by WolframAlpha.
You will also have to edit in `FTPAtomUploader.java` the Strings called `userName`, `password`, and `ftpServer`.

When you're done, go into the main class (`Atom.java`) and Run the app. If you have any issues with the software, please feedback here.
